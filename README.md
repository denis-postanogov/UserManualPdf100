# UserManualPdf100 Dataset

Collection of multilingual User Manuals (PDF documents) to use as a test dataset for different projects.

## How to obtain PDF files

From the project's directory, run:

    make

or (to run 10 download jobs simultaneously):

    make -j 10

This will download 100 PDF files from their original internet links listed in `data/pdf-links.txt`, and place them into 'pdf' directory. Total download size is expected 479,018,455 bytes in 100 files. Each file will be checked against its expected checksum. Please report the author if download fails.

## Language annotations for pages

As some projects require information about the languages used in the document, or the language of the document page, the file `data/pdf-page-lang-annotation.txt` contains annotation of mono-lingual pages of 100 documents.

E.g., the following line:

        UMP100-00536704.pdf   4   eng   eng
     
means that the document "UMP100-00536704.pdf" has page #4 with "English" language identified by 
human annotator (based on viewing the document), and "English" language detected (based on automatic 
analysis of text extracted from page using langdetect system described in \[1\]).

Language annotation statistics:

## How to obtain image files for PDF pages

Some projects require 

Run:

    make produce_png
    
or (to run 10 simultaneous jobs on your powerfull server):

    make -j 10 produce_png
    
This will create directory 'images' and generate 7,291 PNG image files in PNG format from the pages of PDF documents with definitely known language. The image files will be distributed in directories according to language code (ara, bul, ces, dan, deu, ell, eng, ...) and named as follows:

        images/eng/UMP100-00536704.pdf.004.png 

This file is English language page #4 from PDF file "UMP100-00536704.pdf". 

The number of generated PNG files in each folder is given in the last column of above table. Resolution for generated PNG files is 300 dpi, with total size 3,812,807,702 bytes in 7,291 files.

### Dependency
